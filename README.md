**1. Deep Learning - Neural Networks - Prediction of Brake Failure in Scania Trucks**
   
This dissertation investigates the use of neural network models for predicting brake failures in Scania trucks, addressing a notable research gap in heavy-duty truck maintenance. Through comprehensive analysis and literature review, it highlights the importance of brake systems and the potential of neural networks for predictive maintenance. Utilizing the CRISP-DM methodology, three neural network models are developed and tested, showcasing varying degrees of accuracy and efficacy. The study concludes with insights into their practical application and future research directions, emphasizing the significant contribution to enhancing safety and operational efficiency in heavy-duty truck maintenance.

**2. R programming, HDFS and Tableau - Data Management and Data Visualization**

   This project delves into the extensive dataset provided by the Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) to uncover insights and trends within New York City's Yellow Taxi industry. With challenges like the rise of ride-hailing services, the medallion crisis, and the impact of COVID-19, understanding passenger demand patterns and trip dispersion becomes crucial. By leveraging advanced data analytics techniques and tools such as R programming for data preprocessing and analysis, Tableau for interactive visualizations, and HDFS for collaboration, the aim is to transform raw data into actionable recommendations for SHU Consultancy. The project involves collecting and cleaning trip records data, identifying key performance indicators, and delivering comprehensive reports with pragmatic recommendations. Ultimately, the goal is to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of Yellow Taxi services, improving the passenger experience and informing strategic decision-making for SHU Consultancy.
